README - Arrays Problems

  This project contains solutions to various array-related problems using C++. Each problem demonstrates different techniques and algorithms for manipulating arrays, such as searching, sorting, reversing, finding maximum/minimum values, and more.

  How to Use:
  - Each solution is implemented in C++ and can be compiled using any standard C++ compiler.
  - To run a specific problem, uncomment the relevant code section in 'array.cpp' or create separate files for each problem.

  Topics Covered:
  1. Array Initialization and Input/Output
  2. Searching (Linear and Binary Search)
  3. Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
  4. Reversing Arrays
  5. Finding Maximum and Minimum Elements
  6. Removing Duplicates
  7. Merging Arrays
  8. Rotating Arrays
  9. Subarray Problems (Sum, Maximum Subarray, etc.)

  Feel free to add more problems and solutions as you practice. Happy Coding!
